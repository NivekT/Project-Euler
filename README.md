Project-Euler
=============

Some Project Euler problems that I have solved using Python.

Hello! Welcome to my repo!

I am a high school student who is extremely interested in computer programming. I plan to study Computer Science in college and pursue a career in the technological field.

Python is the second programming language which I had extensively learned. In this repo, you will find some Project Euler problems that I have solved. I mostly work on these problems in my spare time for fun. I have solved over 20 problems as of this update. I will continue to upload them when I have time.

Currently, I am also exploring other languages, such as Java and JavaScrip, via online resources (Codecademy, MIT OpenCourseWare, and etc.). I still consider myself as a beginner, but I am getting better and better everyday.

Feel free to leave any comments about my codes. Also, I can always use a mentor. Please let me know if you would like to teach a motivated teenager on Computer Science!

Thank you for visiting my repo! :)
